# Image Classifier
This is my first attempt at building an image classifier. Most all of the code
is taken directly from the
[pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)
with some clean up and conversion into a class structure. It's only 62%
accurate, so the next step is certainly to get the accuracy up.

## Get Started
```bash
python3 setup.py develop # install deps and scripts
trainer                  # tain and export model
tester                   # test model for accuracy
predictor                # run a prediction
```
